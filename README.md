**This is [@albertzak's](https://twitter.com/albertzak) quick & dirty fork to make Hans compile on Ubuntu. OSX & Ubuntu binaries are included.**

Hans makes it possible to [tunnel IPv4 through ICMP echo packets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_tunnel), so you could call it a ping tunnel. This can be useful when you find yourself in the situation that your Internet access is firewalled, but pings are allowed.

Hans runs on Linux as a client and a server. It runs on Mac OS X, iPhone/iPod touch, FreeBSD and OpenBSD as a client only.

Is is inspired by [icmptx](http://thomer.com/icmptx/) and adds some features:

### Reliability
 - Hans works reliably in situations when the client is behind a firewall that allows only one echo reply per request.

### Security
 - Hans uses a challenge-response based login mechanism.

### Multiple clients
 - Hans currently supports up to 253 clients, which is the number of available IPs on the virtual subnet.

### Easy setup
 - Hans automatically assigns IP addresses.

## Get Hans

[Original Hans source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hanstunnel)

[Hans Mac OS X binary.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hanstunnel/files/osx)

For the iPhone/iPod touch version have a look at [tunemu.](http://code.gerade.org/tunemu/)

## Quick Start

[Documentation](http://code.gerade.org/hans/)

### Compiling

    make

### Running as a server

    ./hans -s 10.1.2.0 -r -p password -u nobody
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

### Running as a client

    ./hans -c server_address -p password -u nobody

### Help

    ./hans


## Use Hans

First, make sure you kernel supports [tun](http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/) devices. For Mac OS X you can get the drivers [here.](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/)

To compile hans, unpack it and run make:

    tar -xzf hans-version.tar.gz
    cd hans-version
    make

### To run as a server (as root):

    sudo ./hans -s 10.1.2.0 -p password

This will create a new tun device and assign the IP 10.1.2.1 to it. Note that Hans can not receive echo requests on BSD systems. Therefore the server only works on Linux.

### To run as a client (as root):

    sudo ./hans -c server_address -p password

This will connect to the server at `server_addess`, create a new tun device and assign an IP from the network `10.1.2.0/24` to it.

Now you can run a proxy on the server or let it act as a router and use NAT to allow the clients to access the Internet.

## Troubleshoot / Tweak

### Can't get it to compile?

Make sure you have GCC and some other basics installed:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential

### Can't connect?

If you are behind a firewall that filters icmp packets in any way, which is likely, you might have to make some adjustments. During this process it is useful to add the `-fv` options to the command. With this hans stays attached to the terminal and shows some debug output.

First, you should tell your operating system not to respond to echo requests. On Linux this can be done by:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

Now you might want to add the `-r` option to the server command. This tells Hans also to respond to ordinary pings.

By default the client is configured to send 10 poll "echo requests" that can be answered by the server, when data needs to be transmitted. You might want to lower this value using the `-w` flag, if you experience packet loss. You can also try to raise this value to increase the throughput of the tunnel.

In some cases it might be necessary to tell the client to change the echo id or sequence number with each request. This might have a serious impact on performance. You should first try the `-q` flag and if this does not work, the `-i` flag.

Finally you can tell Hans to run as a different user via the `-u` flag.

Note that when you run Hans without any parameters you get a short description of the available commands.
